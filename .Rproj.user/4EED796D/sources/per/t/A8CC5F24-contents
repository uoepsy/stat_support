title: "Chi-Square Tests"
---

<!-- Chi-square tests are statistical tests used to analyze the relationship between two or more categorical variables. There are several types of chi-square tests, including the goodness-of-fit test, the test of independence, and the test of homogeneity. The goodness-of-fit test is used to determine if the distribution of a categorical variable fits a theoretical distribution. The test of independence is used to determine if there is a relationship between two categorical variables. The test of homogeneity is used to determine if there is a difference in the distribution of a categorical variable across multiple groups.  -->

Covariance and correlation are covered in our [DAPR1](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr1) and [USMR](https://uoepsy.github.io/usmr) courses.
