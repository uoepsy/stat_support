title: "T tests"

<!-- T tests are a type of statistical test used to determine if there is a significant mean difference between two sets of data. There are several types of t tests, including independent samples t test, dependent samples t test (also known as a paired samples t test), and one-sample t test.  -->

<!-- The independent samples t test is used when you want to compare the means of two separate groups; the dependent samples t test is used when you want to compare the means of two related groups, and the one-sample t test is used when you want to compare a sample mean to an hypothesised population mean.  -->

T tests are covered in our [DAPR1](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr1) and [USMR](https://uoepsy.github.io/usmr) courses.
